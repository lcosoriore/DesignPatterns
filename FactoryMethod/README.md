#Factory Method

Factory method is a creational design pattern that solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Factory Method pattern defines a method that should be used to create objects, rather than a direct call to the constructor (operator new). 
Subclasses can override this method to change the classes of the objects that will be created.
